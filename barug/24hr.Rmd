## Intro

  - Allstate
  - $\approx 220$ data people
  - Quarterly kaggles
  - 24/48hr time limit

## Strat

```
design etl
while time remains:
    engineer features
    remove features
    fit a gbm
    validate actions
optimize hyperparameters
```

<!-- Words on what a gbm is. xgboost -->

<!-- Zhang said that ideas last about a week, so plenty of time -->

<!-- Small data: linear models. Stuff with greater resources: other models. -->

## Response Engineering

  - High performance gain per time investment
  - Examples:
    - Target a $\Delta$
    - Target a percentage
    - Target a transformation, $\log(y)$ etc

## Feature Engineering

  - Transformed $X$ captures signal better than vanilla $X$
  - Reverse generative process by thinking
  - ...or just throw stuff at wall

## Feature Engineering

  - Combine covariates, custom interactions
  - Map covariates to a new space
  - Treat high-cardinality variables

## Feature Engineering Examples

  - Dates $\rightarrow$ time since something
  - Counts $\rightarrow$ fractions
  - Ordinals $\rightarrow$ ordinals vs group averages

## Feature Pruning

  - Random or unstable predictors do harm
  - Low influence
  - Unexpectedly high influence
  - Counterintuitive trends

## Collaborating

```R
add_dex_features <- function(df) {
  ...
  df
}
```

<!-- Say words on importance of version control, etc, should be obvious. -->

## Validation

  - Want a fast, reliable feedback loop
  - Going quickly around loop is good
  - Every iteration, credibility is lost

<!-- Tradeoff. Zhang "think more and try less". -->

## Validation hierarchy

  - Holdout {fits quickly, overfits quickly}
  - Cross-validation {fits slowly, overfits slowly}
  - Leaderboard

## Model Speedrunning

  - Fewer trees, higher shrinkage (`eta`)
  - Column subsampling
    - `colsample_bytree`
    - `colsample_bylevel`
